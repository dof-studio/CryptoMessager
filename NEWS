    NEWS = { "On the basis of supporting version 0.0.1.1 of the Mimoji algorithm, a new, lighter, and faster Leaf algorithm has been supported",
             "Supported automatic encryption and decryption acceleration using AVX-2 vectorized instruction set, only supporting Leaf algorithm",
             "Supported automatic algorithm selection encryption mechanism, only selecting Mimoji algorithm for very small inputs, otherwise default to Leaf algorithm",
             "Supported file and multi file encryption, using copy and paste monitoring technology similar to text encryption",
             "Supported file and multi file volume encryption models, and can also encrypt and decrypt large files in low memory",
             "Supported the use of ====!!!! to mark the function of converting long text encryption to file encryption at the beginning and/or the end",
             "Supported incomplete text encryption model, when *<...>* When, only the content between the first selection will be encrypted, but it is not compatible with text to file encryption",
             "Supported the function of using instructions to forcibly monitor the clipboard once and perform encryption and decryption in OFF mode, which will force the return of the running result Info",
             "Supported the use of OPENMP for automatic parallel compilation of for loops in the Leaf algorithm, accelerating the encryption and decryption process",
             "Supported new instructions 008, 009, 010, 011, 170 and optimized the mechanism for intercepting, retrieving, and recognizing pipe instructions after they are issued",
             "Updated the functional security mechanism, encrypting kdb. db using local SMS Code key and Leaf algorithm",
             "Updated the convenient security mechanism, and the encoding mode of SMS Code in V2 version has been updated, while keeping compatible with V1 version",
             "Updated the encoding constant and encoding method for DEL Code, enabling more clients to be correctly registered",
             "Updated the multi-threaded model for encrypted encoding, so single threaded operations for encoding and decoding in encryption and decryption will not become a performance bottleneck",
             "[GUI] Supported some interactive functions in the GUI command lines, so you can now use command lines instead of clicking buttons to perform functions",
             "[GUI] Supported help functions in the GUI command lines, so you can use help command to get to know the use of CryptoMessager_GUI",
             "[GUI] Supported a standalone HintLight that can be moved to any place on your desktop, and it can also be used as a switch button",
             "[GUI] Improved the communication techniques between the backend program and the GUI, making toolkit suite more efficient and robust",
             "[GUI] Improved the security mechanism of the GUI invoking system, ensuring that only one backend program can operate at the same time",
