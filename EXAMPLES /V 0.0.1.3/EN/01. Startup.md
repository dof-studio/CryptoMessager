### Reasons why the main program cannot be opened
1. If you are a new user and have not used CryptoMessager_GUI before, then the most likely thing is that there is something wrong with the integrity of the program. You should go to github.com/dof-studio/CryptoMessager/ to get the official release of the program (it has our digital signature) and stop getting our program from unknown sources.
2. If you are already a CryptoMessager user and you encounter this problem after you have updated the version, then it may be due to incompatibility of the local database. You can choose to return to the previous version you used (install the old version to overwrite it), or clear all files in the software installation directory and reinstall the new version (but you will lose all the users' SMS Code and other information you have stored). We do not recommend that users of CryptoMessager update the program frequently, because each of our releases is stable and secure enough.
3. If you encounter the problem of being unable to start the program during normal use, please give priority to whether you are in a development or debugging environment. CryptoMessager cannot be started normally in any virtual machine environment, debugging environment, or environment that potentially threatens the integrity and normal operation of the CryptoMessager program.
4. If you are a user who has already used CryptoMessager and do not meet any of the above conditions, please give priority to considering that your CryptoMessager program and its database have been maliciously tampered with. Any malicious tampering will cause the program to fail to meet the EntryPoint Protection conditions and fail to initialize normally. Please stop the relevant tampering behavior, or use anti-virus software to check whether your computer has been attacked by malicious programs.
5. If your situation does not meet all of the above requirements, please describe your problem in detail in the Iuuse column of our Github comunity. Our developers may (although there is no guarantee that they can solve it) help you troubleshoot the problem.


### Generate your own SMS Code and add yourself to your trusted counterparty first
1. You should first add yourself to the program, otherwise you may not be able to decrypt things you encrypted.
2. First, click the button `Share Me`.
3. The program will ask you to select the method to add yourself. We select `No` to use normal `SMS Code` instead of `SMS Code Telepathy` since it is you who is going to add yourself.
4. Ignore the security alert and continue to clock `No`.
5. Your SMS Code will be displayed directly on the `Console`, like this way (as long as you are using Version 0.0.1.3).
6. Select and copy your SMS Code by using `Ctrl+C` shortcut, and paste it into the inputbar labeled `Import`.
7. Click `New Client`, the program will remind you that you have successfully added this client.


### Before starting to communicate
1. Please note that if you want to communicate with others in an encrypted manner, please make sure you have added the SMS Code exported by the other party just like adding your own SMS Code.
2. Please note again that the SMS Code represents all the information of the other user. Please do not publicly transmit anyone's SMS Code on the Internet (please use offline form, such as removable disk, to transmit).
3. If you really need to transmit SMS Code over the network (for example, because the two parties in communication have an irreducible physical distance), you can consider using our `SMS Code Telepathy` function to perform P2P secure key exchange using TCP/IP. For SMS Code Telepathy, you can refer to the corresponding EXAMPLES.
4. Please note that to use the "SMS Code Telepathy" feature, at least one of your devices and the other party's device must have a public IPV6 address. If you are not sure whether your machine has a public IPV6 address, you can refer to the description in the SMS Code Telepathy help document to check.
