# 4. Encrypt Text to Files

### Encrypt ultra-long text to a file
1. Many insecure online communication platforms usually have message length limits, and many mailboxes also have such limits. What if I want to send a very long message? You can encrypt your message text into a file. You don't need to go through the tedious steps of opening a Notepad program, pasting the message, saving it as a file, and manually selecting the location to save it. CryptoMessager can solve this problem for you with just one click.
2. For any plain text content to be encrypted, if the text starts with `====!!!!` or ends with `====!!!!`, then the text will be automatically encrypted into a file and become a Cipher Archive. For example, we can encrypt "Emma, ​​this is pi to 1'000'000 decimal places: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288..." into a file:
```text
【ultra-long text】
Emma, ​​this is pi to 1'000'000 decimal places: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...

【ultra-long text with text-to-file notation】
====!!!!Emma, ​​this is pi to 1'000'000 decimal places: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...

【an alternative way】
Emma, ​​this is pi to 1'000'000 decimal places: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...====!!!!
```
3. Click `Main Button` to open the listening program, press `Ctrl+C` to copy the entire text content, and then press `Ctrl+V` to paste it. CryptoMessager will automatically detect the notation no matter it is at the beginning or the end, and encrypt your text into a cipher archive just like the result of a file.
```text
【ultra-long text】
Emma, ​​this is pi to 1'000'000 decimal places: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...

【ultra-long text with text-to-file notation】
====!!!!Emma, ​​this is pi to 1'000'000 decimal places: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...

【encrypted cipher file】
"Enc_43963a6a2b2655c8_Rdxd7a2.denc.bin"  792KB
```
5. Don't forget to close the monitoring program after encryption is completed.

### Decrypt the cipher file generated from text
1. The process of decrypting a Cipher Archive is the same as decrypting a Cipher Archive encrypted from a file. The result of decryption is a file.　Different from the file structure, if Cipher-to-File encryption is used, the decrypted result must be a txt file. For example:
```text
【ultra-long text】
Emma, ​​this is pi to 1'000'000 decimal places: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...

【ultra-long text with text-to-file notation】
====!!!!Emma, ​​this is pi to 1'000'000 decimal places: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...

【encrypted cipher file】
"Enc_43963a6a2b2655c8_Rdxd7a2.denc.bin"  792KB

【decrypted plain txt file】
"TextFile_b59110a021b5cd45.txt"  976KB
```
2. The file encrypted with Text-to-File will be a txt file with a random name after decryption. Use 'Ctrl+V' to copy this file to a place you like, open it, and it will contain all the text before encryption (of course without `====!!!!`).
```text
【TextFile_b59110a021b5cd45.txt content】
Emma, ​​this is pi to 1'000'000 decimal places: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...
```
