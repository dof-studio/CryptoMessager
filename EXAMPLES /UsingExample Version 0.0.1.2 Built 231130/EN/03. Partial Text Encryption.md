# 3. Partial Text Encryption

### Encrypt a selected part instead of everything
1. In many cases, the confidentiality of the entire message may depend on only a short sentence, not the entire message. In this case, if the message is encrypted all at once, the original message will lose its readability completely, and the receiver will not know what information the message conveys before decrypting it. For example:
```text
Emma, ​​I think we should adjust our investment positions.
We need to invest in some more S&P 500 ETF funds.
The password of the account is a1b2c3d4.
Could you please help me operate it?
```
2. In the above four sentences, the truly sensitive information is the password `a1b2c3d4`. We probably just want to prevent the password from being eavesdropped, rather than making the entire message unreadable after encryption.
3. For Partial Encryption, we support using `*<` and `>*` to mark the part of the text that needs to be encrypted. CryptoMessager will automatically recognize the marked content and encrypt only the marked content, not the entire text. For example, the password `a1b2c3d4` in the above example can be marked like this：
```text
Emma, ​​I think we should adjust our investment positions.
We need to invest in some more S&P 500 ETF funds.
The password of the account is *<a1b2c3d4>*.
Could you please help me operate it?
```
4. Click `Main Button` to open the listening program, press `Ctrl+C` to copy the entire text content, and then press `Ctrl+V` to paste it. From the encryption result, only the selected part is encrypted into ciphertext, while the rest of the message text is retained in its original form.
```text
【partial encryption】
Emma, ​​I think we should adjust our investment positions.
We need to invest in some more S&P 500 ETF funds.
The password of the account is *<a1b2c3d4>*.
Could you please help me operate it?

【partial cipher text】
Emma, I think we should adjust our investment positions.
We need to invest in some more S&P 500 ETF funds.
The password of the account is *<DOFM=136b0dc0=4)Aqb]`r2r{ok\foe^90ng5\95iDv(spsNg^n9U6wz6w1>*.
Could you please help me operate it?
```
5. Don't forget to close the monitoring program after encryption is completed.

### Decrypt a partial cipher text
1. There are two ways to decrypt Partial Cipher Text. Click `Main Button` to open the listening program. First, you can select only the ciphertext part, copy and paste it, and then decrypt it. This way you can get all the encrypted content.
```text
【partial encryption】
Emma, ​​I think we should adjust our investment positions.
We need to invest in some more S&P 500 ETF funds.
The password of the account is *<a1b2c3d4>*.
Could you please help me operate it?

【partial cipher text】
Emma, I think we should adjust our investment positions.
We need to invest in some more S&P 500 ETF funds.
The password of the account is *<DOFM=136b0dc0=4)Aqb]`r2r{ok\foe^90ng5\95iDv(spsNg^n9U6wz6w1>*.
Could you please help me operate it?

【select】
DOFM=136b0dc0=4)Aqb]`r2r{ok\foe^90ng5\95iDv(spsNg^n9U6wz6w1

【only decrypt the cipher part】
a1b2c3d4
```
2. You can also select the entire text, press `Ctrl+C` to copy, and `Ctrl+V` to paste. CryptoMessager will automatically identify the encrypted part of the plaintext and decrypt it. At this time, the content you pasted after decryption will be all the plaintext and the decrypted Partial Cipher Text.
```text

【decrypted】

3. Don't forget to close the monitoring program after decryption is completed.
